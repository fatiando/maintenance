name: Maintenance task
about: Request a task for several Fatiando repositories

---

**Description**

<!--
Describe what should be changed, replaced or implemented. Please be as
detailed as you can in your description. Explain why we should do it and its
benefits.

If the changed is intended to be applied on a single repository, please open an
Issue on it. This repository is only meant to keep track of changes that should
be applied to several repositories.
-->




<!--
Feel free to ask for help. Maintaining a large number of repositories is not
easy and it's better if we split the work.
-->

We know that maintenance tasks are very demanding, so we don't expect a single
person to tackle this issue by themselves. Any help is very welcomed, so please
comment below that you want to take care of the changes on any repository and
we will assign it to you.
