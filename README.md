# Tracking maintenance tasks on the entire project

We use this repository to keep track of every maintenance task that might needed on
more than one repository of the Fatiando a Terra project.

We will open a new Issue for any maintenance task that should be carried out on
several projects and close it when it's already solved on all of them.

We won't use this repository to track changes on any file related to
[`fatiando/contributing`](https://github.com/fatiando/contributing/), please
open an Issue on that repository if needed.
